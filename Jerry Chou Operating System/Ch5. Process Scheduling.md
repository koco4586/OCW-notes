# Basic Concepts
- The idea of multiprogramming:
  - Keep several processes in memory. Every time one process has to wait, another process takes over the use of the CPU.
- **CPU-I/O burst cycle**: Process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O wait.
  - Generally, there is a large number of short CPU bursts, and a small number of long CPU bursts.
  - A I/O-bound program would typically has meny very short CPU bursts.
  - A CPU-bound program might have a few long CPU bursts.

- CPU scheduler:
  - Selects from ready queue to execute.
  - CPU scheduling decisions may take place when a process:
    1. Switches from running to waiting state.
    2. Switches from running to read state.
    3. Switches from waiting to ready.
    4. Terminates.
  - Non-preemptive scheduling:
    - Scheduling under (a) and (d).
    - The process keeps the CPU until it is **terminated** or **switched to the waiting state**.
  - Preemptive scheduling:
    - Scheduling under all cases.
  - Preemptive Issues:
    - Inconsistent state of shared data:
      - Require **process synchronization**.
      - Incurs a cost associated with access to shared data.
    - Affect the design of **OS kernel**:
      - UNIX solution: **waiting** either for a system call to complete or for an I/O block to take place before doing a context switch (disable interrupt).
- Dispatcher:
  - Dispatcher module gives control of the CPU to the process selected by scheduler:
    - Context-switch
    - Jumping to the proper location in the selected program.
  - Dispatch latency: time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another running:
    - Scheduling time.
    - Interrupt re-enabling time.
    - Context-switch time.      
# Scheduling Criteria
- CPU utilization:
  - Theoretically:0% ~ 100% / real systems: 40% (light) ~ 90% (heavy).
- Throughput:
  - Number of completed **processes per time unit**.
- **Turnaround time**:
  - Time of submission to completion.
- **Waiting time**:
  - Total waiting time in the **ready queue**.
- **Response time**:
  - Time of submission to the **first response** is produced.
# Scheduling algorithms  
- First-come-first-serve (FCFS) Scheduling:
  - Example: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8ad5da0-be2d-49ac-9ba4-ceb9e8d128db)
- Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling:
  - Associate with each process the length of its next CPU burst.
  - **A process with shortest burst length gets the CPU first** .
  - **SJF provides the minimum average waiting time**.
  - Two schemes:
    - Non-preemptive: once CPU given to a process, it cannot be preempted until its completion.
      - Example: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cc22c8b-2a18-4b9f-b25d-fc15faea3ece)
    - Preemptive: if a new process arrives with shorter burst time length, preemption happens.
      - Example: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0491171b-9a36-49b1-8e3d-a4b131e866cc)
- Approximate-Shortest-Job-First Scheduling:
  - SJF difficulty: **no way to know length of the next CPU burst**.
  - Approximate SJF: the next burst can be **perdicted** as an exponential average of the measured length of previous CPU bursts.   
- Priority Scheduling:
  - A priority number is associated with each process.
  - **The CPU is allocated to the highest priority process**.
  - SJF is a priority scheduling where priority is the predicted next CPU burst time.
  - Problem: starvation (low priority processes never execute).
  - Solution: aging (as time increases, increase the priority of process).
- Round-Robin (RR) scheduling:
  - Each process gets a small unit of CPU time (time quantum (TQ)), usually 10 ~ 100ms.
  - After TQ elapsed, process is preempted and added **to the end of the ready queue**.
  - Performance:
    - TQ large: FIFO.
    - TQ small: (context-switch) overhead increases.
  - Smaller response time.
- Multilevel Queue Scheduling (MLQ):
  - Ready queue is partitioned into **separate queues**.
  - Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm.
  - **Scheduling must be done between queues**.
    - Fixed priority: possibility of starvation.
    - Time slice: each queue gets certain amount of CPU time.
  - Example: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48336a0f-7a54-4e73-8e8f-bec447eb9cf8)
- Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling (MLFQ):
  - A process can **move between the various queues**; aging can be implemented.
  - Idea: separate processes according to the characterstic of their CPU burst:
    - I/O-bound and interactive processes in higher priority queue: short CPU burst.
    - CPU-bound processes in lower priority queue.
  - Example: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/536e10de-abe4-4a71-a567-3b797c676b00)
  - In general, MLFQ is defined by the following parameters:
    - Number of queues.
    - Scheduling algorithm for each queue.
    - Method used to determine when to upgrade a process.
    - Method used to determine when to demote a process.
# Multi-Processor Scheduling
- **Asymmetric multiprocessing**
  - All system activities are handled by a processor.
  - The others only execute user code.
  - Far simple than SMP.
- **Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)**
  - Each processor is **self-scheduling**.
  - All processes in common ready queue, or each has its own private queue of ready processes.
  - Need **synchronization mechanism**.

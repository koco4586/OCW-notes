# Computer system
-  User: people, machines, other computers.
-  Application: define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing problems.
-  Operating System (OS): controls and coordinates the use of the hardware/resources.
-  Hardware: provides basic computing resources.
# What is an OS?
- An OS is the permanent software that controls/abstracts hardware resources for user applications.
- Multi-tasking OS:

- Definition of OS:
    - **Resource allocator**: *manages* and *allocates* resources to insure efficiency and fairness.
    - **Control program**: *controls* the execution of *user programs* and operations of *I/O devices* to prevent errors and improper use to computer.
    - **Kernel**: the one programs running at all times.
- Goals of an OS:
    -  Convenience.
    -  Efficiency.
- Importance of an OS:
    -  System API are the *only* interface between user applications and hardware.
    -  OS code cannot allow any bug.
    -  OS and computer architecture influence each other.

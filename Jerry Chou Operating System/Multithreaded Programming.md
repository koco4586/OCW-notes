# Thread Review
- Lightweight process: basic unit of **CPU utilization**.
- Treads **belonging to the same process** share:
  - Code section.
  - Data section.
  - OS resources (open files, signals, etc.).
- Each thread has its own thread control block (TCB)
  - Thread ID.
  - Program counter.
  - Register set.
  - Stack.

# Benefits of Multithreading
- Responsiveness: allow a process to continue running even if part of it is blocked or is peforming a lengthy operation.
- Resoure sharing: several different threads of activity all within the **same address space**.
- Utilization of MP architecture: Several thread may be **running in parallel** on different processors.
- Economy: Allocating memory and resources for process creation is costly.
  - Lower creation cost vs. Process: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bb7bb9a-8a83-4256-a44a-80327e42ef14)

  - Faster inter-process communication vs. MPI: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/564c669a-46a9-484e-9dcf-ad7dd5456e05)
- Challenges in Multicore Programming
  - Dividing activities: divide program into concurrent tasks.
  - Data splitting: divide data accessed and manipulated by the tasks.
  - Data dependency: synchronize data access.
  - Balance: evenly distribute tasks to cores.
  - Testing and debugging.
# User vs. Kernel Threads
- User threads:
  - Thread management done by user-level threads library:
    - POSIX Pthreads.
    - Win32 threads.
    - Java threads.
  - **Thread library** provides support for thread creation, scheduling and deletion.
  - Generally **fast** to create and manage.
  - If the kernel is single-threaded, a user-thread blocks = entire process blocks even if other threads are ready to run. 
- Kernel threads:
  - Supported by the kernel (OS):
    - Windows 2000 (NT).
    - Solaris.
    - Linux.
    - Tru64 UNIX.
-

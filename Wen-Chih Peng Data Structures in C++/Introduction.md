# System life cycle  
1. Requirements:
   
   The information about inputs and outputs is described in the requirements. Frequently the initial specifications are defined vaguely, and we must develop rigorous input and output descriptions that include all cases.
2. Analysis:
    - Top-down:

      Start with the highest-level design and then break it down into smaller components or modules.
        - Clear Structure.
        - Easier for Planning.
        - Reduced Redundancy.
    - Bottom-up.
3. Design:

    The creation of abstract data type (ADT) and specification of algorithms.
4. Refinement and coding.
5. Verification.

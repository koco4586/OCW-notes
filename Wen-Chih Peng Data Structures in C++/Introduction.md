# System life cycle  
1. Requirements:
   
   The information about inputs and outputs is described in the requirements. Frequently the initial specifications are defined vaguely, and we must develop rigorous input and output descriptions that include all cases.
2. Analysis:
    - Top-down:

      Start with the highest-level design and then break it down into smaller components or modules.
        - Clear Structure.
        - Easier for Planning.
        - Reduced Redundancy.
    - Bottom-up.
3. Design:

    The creation of abstract data type (ADT) and specification of algorithms.
4. Refinement and coding.
5. Verification.
# Algorithm criteria (Knuth's characterization)

   Definition: An algorithm is a finite sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.
1. Finiteness: An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.
2. Definiteness: Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined; the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case.
3. Input: Quantities which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins. These inputs are taken from specified sets of objects.
4. Output: Quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs.
5. Effectiveness: All of the operations to be performed in the algorithm must be sufficiently basic that they can in principle be done exactly and in a finite length of time by a man using paper and pencil.
